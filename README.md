# IDoNotNeedInteractor

I think `interactor` gem could be substituted with 50 lines of ruby and a moderate use of functional patterns.

Long live Interactor.

## Installation

> [!NOTE]
> This gem is not and will not be published on rubygems since it's just a POC

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add i_do_not_need_interactor --github "alessandro-fazzi/i_do_not_need_interactor"

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> I won't write usage instruction for a POC

Tests should demonstrate the use of the toy.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
